## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code uses Python versions 3.*.
The specific libraries required are Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the Udacity Data Science NanoDegree Programme.

Having watched Team GB's performance at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, I was keen to find out more about my home country's performance in prior events:

1. Q1
2. Q2
3. Q3


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. `notebook.ipynb` contains the code for data reading, wrangling, exploration and visualizations.
2. `athlete_events.csv` is the main data source for the project, which contains information about athletes participating in Olympics.
3. `events.csv` manually populated file to class events as ethier indvidual or team events, necessary for getting accurate medal counts.
