## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Programme.

Having watched Team GB's performance at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, I was keen to find out more about my home country's performance in prior Olympic Games, specifically I wanted to understand:

1. Which have been the top 5 most successful Olympics for Team GB?
2. Which events have team GB been the most successful in, how has this changed over time?
3. How well have women been represented in Team GB vs other countries?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. `OlympicsNotebook.ipynb` contains the code for data import, analysis, manipulation and visualisation.
2. `athlete_events.csv` data source for the project, contains data in on all atheletes participating in the modern olympic games
3. `events.csv` manually populated file to class events as ethier indvidual or team events, necessary for getting accurate medal counts.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@benpreston9/analyzing-team-gbs-olympic-history-59c0a2001905).
